## 4.0.0

I've been super slow releasing this one, and there's a ton of new stuff.

Importantly, @keeganbrown managed to upgrade nan to 2.0.9 so this should
work with newer versions of node.

Also a ton of new bindings from @jainanshul

Thanks to the many contributors I haven't named too.

## 3.2.0

Bugfixes from @mvines and @dropfen. Thanks!

### 3.1.0
Many bugfixes from @queuecumber, @emanuelandrada, @thomashoffmann1979,
@paulmorrishill, @zankich, @morganrallen and @AVVS.

### 3.0.0

You wait ages for a release, and 2 come along at once...

This one is awesome. It adds prebuilt binaries, so you don't need
to build opencv for the common platforms.

Many many thanks to @edgarsilva for awesome work here, and
http://hybridgroup.com/ for hosting the binaries


### 2.0.0

- Support for node 0.12
- Camera Calibration Functions from @queuecumber
- Fix for Nan 1.5.1 from @IMGNRY
- More build fixes from @scanlime
- Matrix crop prototype from @dbpieter
- Many fixes from @madshall

Thanks to everyone that contributed!


### 1.0.0

Ok, let's do a proper semver release :)

The big news in this release is that thanks to some amazing work by
@kaosat-dev, node-opencv now works with node 0.11.

Thanks all!
